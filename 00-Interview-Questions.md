Can you describe the difference between progressive enhancement and graceful degradation?
- Progressive enhancement is a way to implement a web page where basic features, which are supported by most environments, are implemented first and then progressively enhance them for advanced environments.
- On the other hand, graceful degradation is an opposite. The advanced features are freely implemented at any time, and additional works are done to support the environment where the features don't work well.
